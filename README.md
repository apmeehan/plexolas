# Plexolas
A coding font based on Consolas, with a touch of [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono).


## Features

* Both regular and bold variants have slightly thinner weight
* For italics, the lower-case `l` 
* Uses the following symbols from Plex Mono: `?`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`

|          | Consolas | Plexolas | A/B |

| italic L | ![](/images/c-italicl.png) | ![](/images/p-italicl.png) | ![](/images/ab-italicl.gif)  |
| symbols  | ![](/images/c-symbols.png) | ![](/images/p-symbols.png) | ![](/images/ab-symbols.gif)  |


## Why

I'm a big fan of Consolas, for its readability, lovely subtly cursive italics, and highly-distinguishable punctuation marks such as commas and backticks. But a few things have always bugged me:
- Its slightly thicker weight compared to other similar typefaces
- That italic `l` is an eyesore
- Its question-mark is unnecessarily stylised
- Its curly brackets aren't so easy to distinguish from the round ones, compared to other typefaces

And while personally I don't find Plex Mono quite as effortlessly readable as Consolas, I do love its style, weight and [heritage](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/selectric/), and actively prefer many of its symbols (such as its no-nonsense question-mark and extra-curly curly brackets).

So Plexolas is basically an attempt to have my cake and eat it.


## Planned updates

* Add more symbols
* Add an optional build step, so that custom combinations of features can be chosen
* This may not work at all, but I'd like to try redesigning every character so that the typeface feels more like a true "Plex + Consolas" hybrid, rather than "Consolas + weight-tweak + a few borrowed symbols"
